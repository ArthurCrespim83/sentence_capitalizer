Sentence Capitalizer

This project implements a Sentence Capitalizer that takes a paragraph as input and returns a new paragraph with the first letter of each sentence capitalized. It is part of the Daily Coding Challenge of the freeCodeCamp platform. 

How it Works

The script iterates through the input paragraph, identifying sentence boundaries based on common punctuation marks: periods (.), question marks (?), and exclamation points (!). The character immediately following these punctuation marks (or the very first character of the paragraph) is capitalized, while all other characters remain unchanged.

Examples

- "this is a simple sentence." becomes "This is a simple sentence."

- "hello world. how are you?" becomes "Hello world. How are you?"

- "i did today's coding challenge... it was fun!!" becomes "I did today's coding challenge... It was fun!!"

- "crazy!!!strange???unconventional...sentences." becomes "Crazy!!!Strange???Unconventional...Sentences."

- "there's a space before this period . why is there a space before that period ?" becomes "There's a space before this period . Why is there a space before that period ?"
